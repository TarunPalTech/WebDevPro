    above line controls that how your web page displayed on different devices:
     ✅ name="viewport"
        Tells the browser you're defining the viewport settings (the area of the page visible to the user).
     ✅ content="width=device-width"
        Sets the viewport width equal to the device’s screen width.
        On mobile devices, this means the layout will match the screen size instead of scaling down a big desktop layout.
     ✅ initial-scale=1.0
        Sets the initial zoom level to 100% (no zoom in or out).
